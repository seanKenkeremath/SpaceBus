SpaceBus
========

Game that uses the tilt hardware and has a framework that allows knew features/levels to be added very easily.  

Extend the abstract Level class and implement buildLevel() to add GameEntity objects which also must be implemented.  
Graphics are cached between levels so that the garbage collector does not running during gameplay.  Beautiful hand-drawn
graphics by me.
